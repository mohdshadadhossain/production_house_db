It combines meticulous database design with efficient data analysis capabilities to unlock actionable insights.

# Key Features
Comprehensive Data Coverage: Captures detailed records of production companies, employee classifications (crew and staff), movies, and financial sources, including grant funding.
Advanced Database Design: Utilizes Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) modeling and normalization to ensure efficiency, accuracy, and maintainability.
Seamless Integration: Links MySQL with MS Access to facilitate user-friendly data querying and analysis.
Data-Driven Insights: Provides structured datasets for detailed analysis of industry trends, workforce dynamics, and financial transactions.
# Tech Stack
Database: MySQL
Front-End Integration: MS Access
Development Tools: XAMPP, MySQL Workbench, MySQL Connector/ODBC
Languages Used: SQL
# Project Objectives
To design and implement a comprehensive database for analyzing the European film industry.
To enable effective data querying for insights into production workflows, employee structures, and financial dynamics.
To provide a flexible system that supports various analytical and reporting needs.
Installation and Setup
# Prerequisites:
Install XAMPP to set up a local MySQL server.
Download and install the MySQL Connector/ODBC for database integration with MS Access.
Steps:
# Database Initialization:
Open PHPMyAdmin and create a new database named production_house_db.
Copy and paste the provided SQL script (production_house_db.sql) into the SQL tab and click Go to execute.
Populating the Database:
The script generates tables with defined relationships and populates them with sample data for analysis.
Linking to MS Access:
Open MS Access and use the MySQL Connector/ODBC to link to the database.
Configure the Data Source Name (DSN) as production_dsn.
Usage Instructions
Use SQL queries in MySQL Workbench or linked MS Access to explore and analyze data.
Perform detailed analysis of:
Employee structures (e.g., crew vs. staff roles).
Financial transactions and grant funding dynamics.
Movie details such as production timelines and budgets.
Generate insights and reports tailored to various stakeholders in the film industry.
# Project Highlights
Normalization and Design Justifications: Ensures data consistency and minimizes redundancy for efficient analysis.
Enhanced EER Model: Clearly represents relationships, attributes, and cardinalities for structured data understanding.
Scalable Implementation: Flexible enough to accommodate additional data or new analytical requirements.
# Impact
This project serves as a vital tool for understanding the European film industry. It facilitates the analysis of business models, financial dynamics, and workforce structures, providing stakeholders with data-driven insights to inform decision-making.
